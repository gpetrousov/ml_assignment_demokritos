# Potential topics - Supervised

#### 1. Binary Classification : Predicting Overtaking Difficulty in F1 🚥

- Use data from ErgastAPI (fastf1) - pulls data from the official F1 systems
- Inject weather data?


#### 2. Regression Project: Predicting Pit Stop Duration ⏱️

- Goal: Predict the total duration of a pit stop (in seconds) based on pre-stop conditions.


#### 3. Clustering Project: Unsupervised Strategy Analysis 🧩

- Use KNN to identify distinct strategies used by the teams for a race.
- Not sure about scale


#### 4. Music genre classification + PCA 🎵

- Algos: Random Forest, SVM
- Connects well with PCA to reduce features
- Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carlthome/gtzan-genre-collection
- Easy to compare
- Involves signal analysis and comprehension


# Potential topics - UNsupervised

Use Q-learning (algorithm) in the following projects:
