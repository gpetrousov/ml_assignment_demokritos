## Project 1: Predicting Pit Stop Duration ⏱️

- Goal: Predict the total duration of a pit stop (in seconds) based on pre-stop conditions.
- Correlate with pit stop videos.


## Directory: `f1_assignment`


### Goals outline

#### Primary

- [ ] Library to build `DataFrame` for GP races
- [ ] Library to add race telemetry to `DataFrame`
- [ ] Regression model for all GP races concatenated
- [ ] Regression model per GP race
- [ ] Regression model per team (for a F1 strategist)

#### Secondaries - Exploratory

- [ ] Train Forest model for pit stop timeframe classification
- [ ] Train a neural net and correlate with statistical model

#### Outcomes

- [ ] Attempt to predict pit stop time accuracy as close as possible.
- [ ] Library which builds the `DataFrame` on top of `fastF1`.
- [ ] Find properties affecting accuracy the most.
- [ ] Compare results to a neural network.
